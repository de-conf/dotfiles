# Font configuration (changes require restart)
#
# Important font attributes like antialiasing, subpixel aa, and hinting can be
# controlled through fontconfig. Specifically, the following attributes should
# have an effect:
#
# * hintstyle
# * antialias
# * lcdfilter
# * rgba
#
# For instance, if you wish to disable subpixel antialiasing, you might set the
# rgba property to "none". If you wish to completely disable antialiasing, you
# can set antialias to false.
#
# Please see these resources for more information on how to use fontconfig
